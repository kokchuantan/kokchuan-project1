# Project 1 post mortem


## Approach and Process

### 1. What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
* Have better CSS animations(shuffle deck, deal cards etc.)
* Have a smarter AI ( knows how to read its hand and raise bets accordingly)

	
### 2. What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
* I found pseudo coding really useful in helping me visualise how I want to code the program. 
  I was coding while referring to it so it made the process a lot clearer and smoother

## Code and Code Design

### 1. What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
* I feel that some of my codes are quite repetitive and thus look quite messy to me 
so I hope to find a better way to write it next time.
* Line 502-620

### 2. What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
* I think that the most successful part of the code was the logic behind the win conditions, especially the one
to check for straight flushes.
* Line 435 - 483

#### For each, please include code examples.
1. Code snippet up to 20 lines.
2. Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

## WDI Unit 1 Post Mortem

### 1. What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
* I feel comfortable using if else statements so I think I used quite a lot of them. 
* Thinking of writing out the logic of the win condition was challenging but I felt satisfied when I managed
to figure them out so thats what I feel motivated me to continue along as I was coding.

### 2. What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
* I found arranging the code to the correct alignment really helps in figuring out where the code starts
and end, which was really useful as I use alot of nested loops. 

### 3. How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
* This unit actually feels rather familiar as I have touched on front-end coding before when 
i was studying for my diploma. 
* I'm still not comfortable with manipulating CSS to make the page 
look like what I had in mind.
